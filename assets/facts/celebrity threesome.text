{ "facts": [ "An injunction was banning the media in England and Wales from reporting the identity of a married celebrity who allegedly took part in a threesome.",

             "The case started in January, when the Sun on Sunday was contacted by a couple, AB and CD, with whom, the married celebrity - referred to only as PJS - had the sexual threesome.",

             "The identities of the celebrity couple are already allowed to be printed in China, America, Spain and even Scotland, but in England an injunction means publicising their names carries a hefty punishment.",

             "Their identity had become an open secret after they were named by publications in the US and Scotland."
